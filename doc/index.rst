ftrack Connect Pipeline Framework
#################################


Welcome to ftrack-connect-pipeline's documentation!

.. important::

    This is the new DCC framework for :term:`Connect` 2 written in :term:`Python`.
    If you are migrating from the old Connect framework then please read the dedicated
    :ref:`migration guide <release/migrating_from_legacy_connect_framework>`.


This document is intended to bring a deeper understanding of how the new Connect 2
:term:`framework` works under the hood, enabling developers to customize it to their
particular needs.

For a general introduction on how to install and use ftrack Connect 2 out of the box,
please head over here: https://www.ftrack.com/en/portfolio/connect

The documentation is divided into two main parts, the first part is where we describe
the new Connect 2 framework and the second part is where we customise it to fit our needs.
