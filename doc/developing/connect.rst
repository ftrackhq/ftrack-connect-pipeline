Building deploying Connect centrally
************************************

To minimise IT administrative tasks, one could build Connect and launch it from a central location. Simply checkout Connect 2 from Bitbucket repository, and run “pip install ftrack-connect”.

A Connect executable is then compiled, which can be set to run a login time on workstations and be wrapped with a proper launcher having an icon.
