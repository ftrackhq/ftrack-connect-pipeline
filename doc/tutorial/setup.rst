Setup
*****


Prerequisites
*************

For this exercise we require to following:

 * A workstation, in our example a PC running Windows 10.
 * A text editor for syntax highlighted editing of Python code, for example PyCharm or Visual Code.
 * Git command line tools installed, including Git bash.
 * A licensed version of Maya 2022 or later.
 * A valid ftrack trial or subscription.
 * ftrack Connect 2 Package installed, with the new framework.
 * A central storage scenario setup to point to your studio network file share.



Git repositories
****************

We assume you start fresh and do not wish to use an existing pipeline Git repository.

..  important::

    If you have an existing repository, you can incorporate the new framework by
    checking out separately and building it to a branch which you later update and
    merge upon new Connect/framework releases.
